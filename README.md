# Status Bar File Name & Recent Files

This IntelliJ Platform plugin shows the currently open file name in the status bar.  
This is useful when in full screen, with the navigation bar and editor tabs hidden.

Clicking it will bring up a list of Recent Files, and selecting one of them will open that file.
